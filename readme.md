# E-Commerce Image Product Classification

In this project, I want to show you my computer vision project about image classification. The dataset that I used from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikashrajluhaniwal/fashion-images) and in the description said that in e-commerce industry, product images provide better first impression to the people who watched that images. So, this is my reason why I making this project.

The dataset contains more than 2900 images that are separate in two part that are Apparel and Footwear and eact of them also divided into two part that are Men and Women. So, My computer vision will classify the image object into 4 class.
